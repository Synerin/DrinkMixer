# Drink Mixer
###### Title in progress

Hello! This is the beginning development of an app idea that I had.

One of my favorite things to do at movie theaters and casual restaurants is to mix various sodas together to create a memorable new beverage. I thought that it would be neat to be able to share these drink ideas with friends and the community. With this in mind, and having recently taken a Mobile Development course at my university, I figured that it could be a good idea for an app! There are certainly a few great recipes that I'd like to share.

This project will be one of the larger undertakings for me, but I hope that it comes out alright!

Some ideas that I'd like to implement are as follows,

- [ ] User sign-in
- [ ] Catalogue of flavor options
- [ ] Catalogue of drink options
- [ ] Custom colors and containers for drinks
- [ ] Community voting

I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish this project in a reasonable time, or even at all. But I sure would like to. It would be nice to be able to make a bit of money for a possible trip next year.

Thanks for reading!

Jason
